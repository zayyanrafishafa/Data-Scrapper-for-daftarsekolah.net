# Data-Scrapper-for-daftarsekolah.net
During my time as a Data Analyst and Market Intern I was tasked with Data Scrapping from a website that provides list of schools that then can be used to provide information regarding schools around certain regions (Province, cities, etc.). 

My supervisor tasked me with scrapping data of institutions or schools that were established by The Ministry of Religion (KEMENAG). I accessed daftarsekolah.net and began inserting the codes to scrap the data in Google Colab and ran the cells.

The result, I obtained the data of the schools that were requested. Data scrapping method helps acquire data of these schools profiles much faster and effeciently. Manual data transfer could take almost half a day while processing the scraping sequence would only take around half an hour or 3 hours (depends on the amount of data being taken). The employee won't need to open the page one by one.
